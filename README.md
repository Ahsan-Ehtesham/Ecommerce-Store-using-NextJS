Guidelines for raising a new issue:
Each issue should have an appropriate and short title like "Bug in Experience Page"

Whenever a participant raises an issue, by default it would be assigned to that participant due to obvious reasons.

Be specific about your intended changes/suggestions

Refrain from using phrases like "Hi, I am ..", "Please assign me this issue", "Thank You..", etc. We are only interested in technical parts

Attach a screenshot/clip if applicable

Please be patient enough. The project maintainers/mentors would review it as per their schedule. Refrain from putting up comments like "Please check this" ,"Please review this PR" etc.

An issue would be assigned to a participant for a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 3 days. If the tenure of a particular participant is not over please do not spam the issue thread by writing, " I am interested" etc. You are welcome to do so if the participant has not met the requirements with around 12 hours remaining for their deadline.

Feel free to suggest your opinions on the already raised issues.

All participants are welcomed to suggest new features/bug fixes/improvements and raise new issues for those. However, the assignment would be done once approved by either of the project maintainers or the mentors.

Do not blindly comment on issues raised by other participant(s). Unless a minimum of 48 hours has passed since their assignment, the issue would not be re-assigned(excluding certain cases). The issue raised by a participant will always to be assigned to him/her by default. Do not spam "Interested", "Please assign me" in others issues.

Always keep a note of the deadline.

8. Click on Create Pull Request.



Guidelines for raising a pull request:
Each pull request should have an appropriate and short title like "Fixed Bug in Experience Page"

In case of multiple commits, please perform a rebase and make a squash commit before giving the pull request.

Pull Requests without a description would often not be reviewed. Make sure you describe your intended changes in the description section of the pull request. (Use bullet points and phrases)

Make sure to refer the respective issue in the respective PR using phrases like Resolves #issue_number or Closes #issue_number. Here's an example to raise a PR:

```
 Fixes #640

# Work Done:

- Fixed Responsiveness bug in the MOOC Section of the Education Page
- Made the Favicon more optimized
- ...
- ...
- ...

# Relevant Screenshots/Gifs
```

# Relevant Screenshots/Gifs
Refrain from using phrases like "Hi, I am ..", "Please merge me this PR", "Thank You..", etc. We are only interested in technical parts.

Attach a screenshot/clip of the change(s).

Please be patient enough. The project maintainers/mentors would review it as per their schedule. Please do not start putting comments like "Please check this" etc.

Not every PR would be merged directly. In majority of the scenarios, we would be offering some additional suggestions which are to be incorporated in the same PR with a squash commit.

Look out for possible merge conflicts. Please add comments required, this makes your code readable.

Make sensible variable names. For example, card1 is quite ambiguous but education_card implies what that variable is declared for.

Although we support feedback from everyone in all phases of development, it is highly advised not to put any negative comments in other participant's pull requests.

Always keep a note of the deadline.

9. Voila ‚ùó You have made a PR to the Ecommerce-Store-using-NextJS project üí• . Sit back patiently and relax while the project maintainers review your PR. Please understand at times the time can vary from a few hours to a few days.
